        <b>Tutor Society’s (TS) aim is to welcome you as a new student at VIA University College, Campus Horsens and get you familiar with the study environment socially and educationally.
It is TS’s responsibility to introduce you to the town and campus, as well as insure that you get the best start to the heightened academic level during the introduction week.
Subscribing to TS’s Introduction Program will provide you with the best possible start. 

During this week of introduction you will have the chance to meet many new friends who are all in the same situation as you.
Integration is important part of starting a new education. Therefore in order for you to feel safe and comfortable in your new environment, you will have a reliable support and friend in the long run in the face of the tutor.

Campus Horsens is a beautiful and fun place to study and TS will make sure you can explore it since your first week here and you will never forget it through your time as a student.

Kind regards Tutor society You never had it this good!

    <p title="The Student Bar" class="openTop red" style="top:500px;left:90px;">
        <b>The student bar is the place where students meet across age, study program and nationality. The lowest prices in town combined with activities free of charge makes it an ever-popular meeting place to many people.

The bar is the best place to go if you like shooting pool, play table football or just want to have a fun afternoon and evening.
Each semester, different theme nights and live music spice up the atmosphere. An example is the jam session, where the students bring their own instruments and play music together. Their enthusiasm exceeds the talent but nevertheless, it is a VERY popular event.

The bar is run by students from VIA UC, meaning that you will almost always meet a familiar face behind the bar ready for a chat or a game of backgammon or Bezzerwizzer.</b>

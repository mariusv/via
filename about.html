						<h2>Tutor Society</h2>
						<p>Tutor Society’s (TS) aim is to welcome you as a new student at VIA University College, Campus Horsens and get you familiar with the study environment socially and educationally.
It is TS’s responsibility to introduce you to the town and campus, as well as insure that you get the best start to the heightened academic level during the introduction week.
Subscribing to TS’s Introduction Program will provide you with the best possible start. During this week of introduction you will have the chance to meet many new friends who are all in the same situation as you.
Integration is important part of starting a new education. Therefore in order for you to feel safe and comfortable in your new environment, you will have a reliable support and friend in the long run in the face of the tutor. Campus Horsens is a beautiful and fun place to study and TS will make sure you can explore it since your first week here and you will never forget it through your time as a student.</p>

						<h2>Reactions</h2>
						<p>At the time of its introduction the canvas element was met with mixed reactions from the web standards community. There have been arguments against Apple's decision to create a new proprietary element instead of supporting the SVG standard. There are other concerns about syntax e.g. the absence of a namespace.</p>

						<h2>Support</h2>
						<p>The element is currently supported by the latest versions of Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari, and Opera. It is not natively implemented by Internet Explorer (IE) as of version 8, though support is in development for Internet Explorer 9; however, many of the Canvas element's features can be supported in IE, for example by using Google or Mozilla plugins, JavaScript libraries and either Adobe Flash or IE's proprietary VML.</p>

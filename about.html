						<h2>Tutor Society</h2>
						<p>Tutor Society’s (TS) aim is to welcome you as a new student at VIA University College, Campus Horsens and get you familiar with the study environment socially and educationally.
It is TS’s responsibility to introduce you to the town and campus, as well as insure that you get the best start to the heightened academic level during the introduction week.
Subscribing to TS’s Introduction Program will provide you with the best possible start. During this week of introduction you will have the chance to meet many new friends who are all in the same situation as you.
Integration is important part of starting a new education. Therefore in order for you to feel safe and comfortable in your new environment, you will have a reliable support and friend in the long run in the face of the tutor. Campus Horsens is a beautiful and fun place to study and TS will make sure you can explore it since your first week here and you will never forget it through your time as a student.</p>

						<h2>Revolve Magazine</h2>
						<p>In a country where it rains 350 days a year and everybody still rides bikes, Denmark, we decided to create a community of self-expression.
Revolve is an independent magazine created entirely by students and for the students at VIA University College, Campus Horsens in Denmark.

Campus Horsens is the most international in Denmark and almost half of the students are foreign, mostly not speaking Danish, therefore Revolve is an entirely English-written magazine.</p>
